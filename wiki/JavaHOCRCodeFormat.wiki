= Code Format =

Be sure to check your code before checking the code. Only functional code and formatted code:
  * Use our eclipse-code-formatter-profile.xml see r24
  * No @author tag needed, see [http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1037207/apache-enforces-the-removal-of-author-tags Apache removes author tag] and [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17269843/javadoc-author-tag-good-practices Javadoc @author tag good practices]
  * When to commit? Commit only when you have successfully unit tested the given function/module/functionality and you are reasonably assured that it is ready for integration or system testing, see:  [http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/83837/when-to-commit-code When to commit code?]
